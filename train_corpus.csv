2585,yes,The supervisor knocks over a cup of coffee and instantly blames the student worker. the student worker argues that they just watched the supervisor do it. The supervisor looks at them like they're crazy and proceeds to tell the student worker to clean it up. maybe they even use their position to try and threaten to have them written up if they don't obey and take the blame.,70
2603,yes,"The supervisor claims that the worker never restocked the cups when they asked to do so, but the student had not talked to the supervisor yet today. The student knows they could not have been asked to do that task but the supervisor continues with this idea and yells at the student until they cave and apologize or do the task. ",61
2604,yes,"A worker went into work at 8 in the morning, but their boss didn't see them. Then the boss tells the worker that they didn't come in at 8 but they actually came in at 10 even though the worker knows for a fact that they have been working since 8. ",53
2627,yes,A customer claims that the worker made a mistake but they actually did not. When the supervisor is called over the worker tries to explain but is quickly interrupted by the customer. The supervisor consoles the worker later that they are doing a great job but later finds out from a coworker the supervisor was speaking badly of them behind their back.,62
2661,yes,"The supervisor forgets to put the coffee beans away during the closing shift. The supervisor tells the student worker it was them who forgot. The student worker tells them that putting the beans away was the supervisors job the previous shift because they were told to mop the floor. Instead of realizing they made a mistake, the supervisor gas lights the student into believing it was their fault. ",68
2668,yes,One day  I was having a bad day as I had ordered a really nice coffee machine which was stolen off my front door and my whole day was spoilt. So when I was telling my friends about they were rubbing in it that I lost my coffee machine which in short is an example of gaslighting ,57
2739,yes,"When the shop is so crowded the manager had to lend me a hand. He told me he got it covered and I can go on the next order, but then the customer came to complain to him the order was wrong and he apologized blaming all of it on me, telling me busy with other orders right in front of the customer that I'd get my salary cut.",70
2742,yes,The student cleans the coffee shop after closing which consists of wiping down and mopping. He throughly cleans in a speedy manner to get home. The supervisor says it's not clean due to not spending the time he believed was needed to clean everything which resulted in the student having to stay longer. ,54
2755,yes,My mom indulges in drugs and when i found then she told me they were mine and i was going to use them. I remember going to grab a lighter and pulling out meth. I was very sad so i said something and she flipped the whole thing on me like she caught me. ,54
2759,yes,"The student worker has just been sexually assaulted by her other coworker. She goes to her supervisor and tells them the issue. The supervisor says that's not true, and to not make such accusations. The student worker feels like she's crazy because she isn't being believed by someone who has access to the security camera footage. ",59
2778,yes,the student worker would probably be cleaning up something that was spilled by the supervisor bumping into them on purpose then  the supervisor of the coffee shop would say something in the terms of why did you make the mess all over the floor then the student worker would say that was not my fault that  was all yours since you spilled it. ,63
2796,yes,The student checks the schedule and sees they work Monday Wednesday and Friday. The supervisor made a mistake when planning the schedule and realizes the shop is short staffed on Tuesday morning. They reprint the schedule to show the student scheduled as needing to work Tuesday. they text the student five minutes after opening demanding to know where they are and threatening their job over lateness. ,66
2806,yes,"The student worker tries to finish an order that was given by the supervisor but the supervisor gaslights him into thinking he didn't give him the order and was told to work on another. The student proceeds to argue with the supervisor and he responds with ""I think you're exaggerating"" and proceeds to go along his work. ",59
2814,yes,"A student worker does well in his job. However, his boss tries to convince him that he makes many mistakes in his job. For example, his boss tells hi he always messes up people's orders and never balances the cash register correctly. The student worker feels embarrassed and confused and feels targeted by his employer.",56
2825,yes,"An incident is perhpas the supervisor one night had forgotten to lock up shop which lead to a robbery and some cash from the register was stolen. Rather than the supervisor taking the blame for it, they may have made the student worker believe that they were the one who forgot to lock up shop when truly it was the supervisor. ",61
2842,yes,Maybe the supervisor sees there is something wrong in the coffee shop and has no one to blame but the student worker. The supervisor starts yelling at the student worker that they did this and that and make them feel bad about it even if it was not their fault.,50
2859,yes,"Say the manager told the worker specific ways to complete tasks at eh coffee shop, but after someone complains about something the manager starts yelling at the worker for messing up and claims they didnt follow the directions given by the manager; when in reality the worker did follow directions, the manager just did not want to be at fault so convinced the worker it was their fault ",68
2879,yes,"The supervisor gaslights the student worker for making him seem like he is asking for too much. Like the student working is asking for a raise or for better benefits, and instead the supervisor is making it seem like he is such a great boss and that asking for more is insulting. This makes the student feel bad and no longer want better benefits.",64
2898,yes,The supervisor gaslights the student worker into thinking that they do not work hard enough in the shop and never get things done properly. This can be done by telling the student tables are still dirty and people complained of their service (which is not true). This is done to try to make the student work more. ,57
2909,yes,"The supervisor purposefully embarrasses the worker in front of others to feel 'big and mighty'. The worker feels small and is often on edge, feeling that anything that they do will be used against them. The boss only views the worker as an amusement tool, not at all as person. Calling them nicknames, which then becomes their name in the workplace.",61
2937,yes,"I came into work 15 minutes before my shift started, which is when the supervisor and my friend who also works at the shop told me to come in. When I come in for work, the supervisor tells me that I am 15 minutes late, and that they told me to come in a half hour before the shift started. They told me I am lying about them saying otherwise.",70
2948,yes,"The student is accused of messing up an important customers order. The student does not recall ever making a mistake on an order or being confronted by any customer because of an error.

Due to the supervisor's insistence on the mistake, the worker believes they messed up and blames themselves for being careless. ",69
2957,yes,"I was working in the coffee shop one day and I saw my manager attempt to take another break when she already had one. I mentioned it and she said "" I don't know why you're making such a big deal out of this"".

2960,yes,"Let's say the worker closed the coffee shop the night before. The next day she goes into work and her supervisor tells her she forgot to clean one of the machines, but she knows for a fact she cleaned it. He keeps telling her no she didn't clean it, despite her knowing she cleaned it. She starts to second guess whether or not she really did clean it.",70
2966,yes,"My manager keeps telling me that money was stolen from the register on the last night shift. But last night it was only me and her working I said to her that I never stole money out of, the register, but she just keeps calling me crazy and says it was defiantly me that did it.    ",56
2967,yes,the supervisor could gaslight the student worker into worker longer hours because there is no one else that could be put on the schedule. The reality of it is that the supervisor likes this student worker the best so he lies and says that no one else is available.,49
2978,yes,"Despite the student working long hours the manager berates them for not working hard enough. If the worker messes up the manager humiliates them in front of their coworkers. If the manager promised a raise but asked later about it they'll blatantly lie despite there being proof. Lastly, they'll praise you one second and punish you the next making the student doubt themselves.",65
2980,yes,the supervisor asks the student to come in a little early because the story is busy and that they can leave earlier than usual and when it comes time to leaving the supervisor says that they never said that and it wouldn't make sense because the store is still busy so it means they have to stay longer and that's what was said,65
2996,yes,"the supervisor asked the student to clean the coffee machine. The student did and then continued to work. when the supervisor came back and checked the machine, he was not happy. He went up to the student and asked why she didn't clean it yet. She said she did and the supervisor told her she didn't because it still looked dirty to him. ",65
2997,yes,The student is upset she did not receive her last pay check. She approaches her supervisor to ask about it and he/she claims that the worker is making false claims and must have lost it. The student worker knows that is not true but feels as if they can't speak up any further. ,55
3019,yes,"The student worker and the supervisor both worked late on Friday night. They both had to clean and close the shop for the weekends and reopen on Monday morning. The supervisor forgot to turn off the light during his exit, so gaslit the student worker into thinking it was her fault.",51
3031,yes,"I went to work as usual after school but today was different because I didn't feel ok mentally. My supervisor was clearly in a bad mood and I had to go tell him I needed to go home. After telling him, he told me it was all in my head and I would be fine to finish the shift. That made me even more upset so I quit. ",69
3071,yes,"The student worker one day noticed there pay was short, so they said something to the supervisor. However, the supervisor said they paid them in full and the student worker must have just lost it. When actually the supervisor did not pay them in full and they know that. So, the student worker just lets it go.",57
3086,yes,"I was ringing up a customer who said they wanted coffee with no creamer. As I am preparing the order my manager asks me why there is no creamer in the coffee, when the customer asked for a small coffee. My manager keeps pestering me about it, so I finally add the creamer, just for the customer to say that they didn't want it.",65
3099,yes,Today at work my boss withheld money from my tips. The amount he gave me was far too low and upon confronting him about it he tells me he has no idea of what Im talking about. He then continues and says that he gave me more than what he should have and that if I were more attentive I would have noticed there weren't more money.,68
3119,yes,The student warned the supervisor about school being a priority. The student even warned her about finals week and about how she might have to take off.

3126,yes,"A customer walked up to the kiosk and ordered a vanilla latte with oat milk. I made the drink correctly with vanilla syrup and oat milk. My supervisor criticized me and told me that I made the drink incorrectly.

3133,yes,"I put in a request with my supervisor to take Tuesday off of work. I submitted the request verbally and through the app. I never heard otherwise, so I assumed it had been approved. My supervisor called me repeatedly on Tuesday claiming that I never asked him for the day off and never submitted a request, demanding that I come in for my shift. ",64
3209,yes,"The supervisor frequently tells the worker that they are too underperforming of a store to hire more staff, despite higher sales and employees that have left.

3219,yes,"The student is working as the cashier and is also working a double its been 10 hours since the student worker has not gotten a break.

3220,yes,"The student worker is often the recipient of verbal abuse from their manager. One day, the manager tells the worker that they are worthless and stupid. The worker begins to cry, and is confronted by the manager. The manager tells the worker that they are being overdramatic, and refusing to take any personal accountability for causing the worker to cry. This causes the worker to feel embarrassed for getting upset.",70
3221,yes,I am always on time and able to do my job well. I try to come in with a good attitude. My supervisor thinks I am constantly bringing the store mood down and not doing my job correctly. Maybe they are correct. I should start paying attention more and not interacting with my coworkers except about work related things.,59
3272,yes,"I was working in the front as a cashier, a rude customer said I was fat and ugly and demanded a drink. I refused to serve them. My manager then comes up to me mad, yelling why I did not serve the customer. I explain the insults coming at me,  but the manager gaslights me and says they would never say that, I misunderstood and am overreacting. ",67
3277,yes,The manager constantly tells the student worker that they need to calm down or that they are being too emotional about something. The student does not think they are that emotional or need to calm down but the manager keeps insisting that they are to the point where the student begins to believe it. ,54
3305,yes,"The supervisor tells the workers that they said everyone needs to be at work at a certain time, even though they really didn't say that, they just need to cover themselves. nobody will question due to the power dynamic. In this way, the workers are all questioning their version of events against others, some remember the supervisor saying that, some do not. ",63
3339,yes,the supervisor tells the student worker that the coffee is suppose to have 5 drops of flavoring in it and not 4 but in every book and manual it says 4. the student worker feels like she shouldnt listen to this advice as she knows shes right but because the supervisor is telling her this she starts to beilive that she is wrong and he is correct. ,67

3349,yes,"The worker being gaslit may be told by their employer to work a certain shift because they ""owe them a favor"" ,and if they don't then they are going to get scheduled bad shifts. It could also be a situation of you boss making promises for you to hvae off, and scheduling you denying their promise, even if you have proof. ",62
3365,yes,"after the manager sees a new worker spill the milk in the freezer, instead of putting that blame on the new worker, he blames this older student worker for it. even when the student worker denies and denies and says there should be video proof but the manager doesn't care what he has to say for he already made up his mind that it was the student worker. ",69
3383,yes,the student worker is unaware of how to use the coffee machine they supervisor gaslights the student by making it seem like the student should already know. The student was not taught how to use the machine because she works with the bread and stuff. The supervisor says that it is the students fault and blames it on them. Whole time it was the supervisors job to teach before hiring.,70
3390,yes,A student worker didn't receive their pay and makes it known to their supervisor. Their supervisor says that they did.

The supervisor then turns it back around on the student worker and says that they are unappreciative for even asking.,57
3482,yes,My supervisor is cutting my paycheck because I forgot to ring up a customer yesterday. I could have sworn I rang everyone up. I felt really on top of my game yesterday and it's not like me to make such a mistake. But he said he checked the security cameras and I really did not ring them up. I feel like I'm losing grip of reality.,68
3502,yes,The student worker tells their supervisor that their coworker has been making inappropriate comments towards them and it's making them uncomfortable. The supervisor tells the student worker that their is no way the coworker is making comments like that because he is a good worker. The supervisor than asks if the coworker was just being friendly and if the student worker took it the wrong way,67
3509,yes,"The student worker come in for work one day, and the supervisor immediately berates the student worker for not having done a task the other day, that they were explicitly told to do before leaving. The student, knowing they did the task, is convinced by the intimidation of the supervisor that the task was not done, so instead of continuing to argue they apologize for not having done it.",69
3513,yes,I talked to my manager yesterday about my PTO for next week that I was accepted last month.  Now they are saying I never told them nor was it accepted.  They are saying that if I don't come to work I will be fired.  What do I do?,49
3542,yes,My manager walked in on me doing my job the other day. He noticed the way I was making a drink for someone and called me lazy and undetermined. I do my best everyday at work and yet it's never enough for my manager. I guess I'm just a lazy idiot. ,53
3552,yes,"The student worker reminded the supervisor to close out the register. Later, the supervisor gets angry claiming the student worker did not tell them. Student worker reminds supervisor of their reminder, but supervisor denies this ever happening. Student begins to question whether they told their supervisor or not",48
3587,yes,"the student worker comes in on time to work today, he is usually five minuets late which really makes no difference.

3594,yes,"The manager trained the student worker how to scan incoming deliveries such products from vendors.

In the meeting, the manager yelled and suspended the student work for not using the companies method.",63
3616,yes,"The student worker has had many experiences where the supervisor isn't exactly the nicest to them. The student worker brushes it off every time although they were extremely uncomfortable. When the student worker has finally had enough, they inform the supervisor of how they felt they were being treated and the supervisor completely shuts down the student workers feelings suggesting that they were just overreacting.",66
1642,yes,"On Tuesday, the manager tells the worker that the manager will restock all of the coffee grounds for the next day. When Wednesday comes around, the manager yells at the worker for not having restocked the coffee grounds. When the worker tells the supervisor that the supervisor said that they would do it the day before, the supervisor denies the accusation.

2131,yes,"The student worker comes to work one day and is working with their supervisor on a slow day. The supervisor asks if the student can make them coffee with vanilla syrup while they work on the budget for the store, seeing as it's slow.

The supervisor had yelled at the student worker in front of the other employees and even made it believable. However the student worker knew that they had not misplaced the book and that it in fact was where it was supposed to be. The only plausible explanation was that the supervisor had looked at ti to double check everything and misplaced but chose to blame the worker instead. ",106
2221,yes,"Today is another day at work and I really do not want to go. Yesterday he instructed me to waive the payments of some customers that he knows but when management found out he stated that I was the one that did.

He told me that since management is not pressing the issue, I can keep my job and just make a better decision when checking in other customers. ",88
2225,yes,"The student worker speaks to the supervisor about having the weekend off of work and the supervisor allows this. When the weekend arrives, the supervisor calls the student worker, asking where they are.  The supervisor forgot to change the schedule of the student worker but is too prideful to admit it. The student worker says that they were told by the supervisor that it was okay but the supervisor claims this never happened. The supervisor might say, ""I would remember if you asked me, maybe you're the one who forgot to ask permission.""",94
2283,yes,"When the student closed up for the night, they did their required work but the next day the supervisor tells them they did not do all required work from the nigh before.

The student worker knows her boss did this, but he boss comes up to her while she is cleaning it up and asks why she knocked over the cup.

The student worker second guesses herself, and assumes she must've accidentally spilled the cup, not her boss.",85
2319,yes,"The supervisor tells the worker to mop the floors, and then sweep them. This has been the rule for months. One day the supervisor tells the worker that they're doing it wrong, that they need to sweep first and then mop.

He makes me stay behind after hours and drills me even though I tell him every time that I have worked at a coffee shop before and know how to work a machine. I know he only does it because he wants me to be a great employee. When he  tells me how he only helps because he knows I can be better. I used to feel undermined and worthless but maybe I really wouldn't be able to work the machine without his help.,96
2370,yes,"The student is probably treated like he is below the supervisor and held to such high expectations at the shop, disregarding the fact that it's a student with other responsibilities. I can see a situation where the student gets a customer order wrong because they misheard them and are under a great deal of stress due to their education. This student probably feels terrible and will offer to make that costumer a new drink. The supervisor then walks by and starts blaming the student and telling him that he will not make it anywhere in life due to a simple misunderstanding of a costumers order.",106
2374,yes,"The manager forgot to close the coffee grounds container before stepping away from the station. By accident, the student worker knocks it over while helping a customer.

That is honestly my best guess of what gaslighting is.",74
2405,yes,"Supervisor tells student he forgot an order. The student responds no he did not and that he has been waiting tables. The supervisor made a really big fus but remembers he was supposed to fulfil that order. To save him from embarrassment he keeps getting angrier and more hostile with the student making his own actions the students fault.

Like for example; ""well you should've been paying attention to the order so I didn't have to make it""",82
3566,yes,I work at a coffee shop on campus. My boss came up to me one day and started complaining about many things I didn't do. He said I didn't count the money in the drawer and I didn't restock the straws. I knew that he was wrong and I kept telling my boss that I did do those things. But my boss didn't care and kept saying he didn't and that if it happened again I would be fired. His words made me feel inferior. ,90

When the worker points out that the supervisor said they'd lock up, the supervisor says that the worker never should've left before making sure the door was locked.  ",97

The supervisor heard this event from the other student workers, and asked the student worker about it. The supervisor proceeded to make this accident bigger than it actually was by blaming the student worker and saying ""It is all your fault...you have always been so clumsy and everyone agrees with me"". This is the first time the student worker has ever had an accident. The student worker began to get upset, and the supervisor passively aggressively stated, ""It was just a joke, can't you tell that I was joking around with you? Why can't you take the joke?""",133
1658,yes,"One morning, as Joe arrives for his early morning ""clopening"" shift at the campus coffee shop, he finds his supervisor in the stock room whipped into a frenzy because the shop has apparently completely run out of oatmilk for the drinks on the plant-based specialty menu-which happen to be the most popular drinks that students order. As soon as Joe's supervisor, Ken, lays eyes on him, Joe knows that he's probably about to be blamed for whatever it is that has Ken so riled up-as usual. Right on cue, as soon as Joe steps foot into the stock room, Ken starts laying into him, saying how he had reminded Joe last week to submit the bulk order for the plant-based menu drinks, which should have included the oatmilk. Still slightly disoriented from having to wake up early right after closing late the night before, Joe tries to defend himself, saying that he doesn't remember Ken ever asking him that; Joe vaguely remembers overhearing Ken asking his coworker, Julie, to put in the plant-based order, but due to his extreme fatigue, he isn't really sure what he remembers happened in that instance. Ken fires back, insisting that he had told Joe specifically to put in the order, and points to the walk-in cold storage doors for emphasis, saying how the two of them had been standing right there when the supposed conversation occurred. Continuing his tirade, Ken reminds Joe how it had been his idea for the shop to expand their plant-based options in the first place, and that now Joe will have to be the one to explain to their customers why their drinks made with oatmilk won't be available until the next bulk shipment comes in. Joe had been the one to suggest that the shop carry more plant-based drinks, so even though he can't remember Ken asking him to put in the order, he figures that he probably should have known that Ken would expect him to do it anyway, and that it probably is his fault for forgetting about it. Once he seemed to be satisfied with Joe's state of submission, as he turned around to walk out the back door, Ken remarks offhandedly that he better get over this forgetfulness if he wants to keep his job. Tying his apron behind his back, Joe lets out a deep sigh as he heads out of the stock room towards the front of the shop to start his opening tasks for the day, feeling like no matter how hard he tries, he never seems to be able to do anything right.",448

""I'm not sure what you're talking about, when we closed I wasn't in the kitchen I was cleaning the seating area and bathrooms."" She questioned. He scoffed ""Don't lie to me. You always make these kinds of mistakes and now you're trying to pin it on someone else like you always do. Just do better I'm sick of this."" Maddie nods her head and walked back to washing her hands now questioning if she maybe did forget to put it back and has she been doing stuff like this all the time.

He was requesting me to go to through an entire departments tests and enter the data into the system. The deadline for it was drastic for a single person. I had requested having someone else help and it was an instant problem. He began to argue stating that ""I was perfection capable of doing the job, or was I?""

Last week I created a new drink by adding a few extra ingredients. I told some of the regulars at the shop to try the drink and my coworkers as well. People started coming in and wanting me to make this specialty drink for them. My manager Tommy talked to the owner of the store about adding this new drink that he created to the menu. When I asked Tommy why he didn't tell the truth about me creating the drink, he kept trying to convince me that it didn't matter that he told the owner he made it because we are a team.

They remind the student worker that it is their fault that they didn't request the day off correctly and will have to work that day.  The student worker asks the supervisor what is the ""correct"" way of asking for a day off.

They inform their supervisor, who tells them they must work extra shifts during the holidays. The student tries to explain they want to go visit their family but their supervisor asks them to think about themself, who doesn't have a family to go home and will be lonely running the coffee shop alone.

Did I do anything wrong? I hope he doesn't yell at me in front of all these people. Please walk away."" The supervisor arrives at her workstation and overviews what she is doing.

Their supervisor once again told them that they had miscounted and suggested that the student worker must've been exhausted.

When doing inventory, the manager blames the worker for low oat milk, and says ""its because you always give it to people without charging!"".

The student worker alerted the manager right away about what happened and did not skip the shift.

This shift is so busy that once the student worker gets to the time of his break, he won't waste a second. Unfortunately, the student workers boss only gives him 15 minutes of a break instead of 45.

The customer says without looking up from her phone. ""Sure, that'll be $3.00"". I begin making her latte just as my supervisor, Mike, walks out from the back office. ""Hey what's up Stacy"" he says with a smirk. ""Hey."" I say blandly. ""Stacy, the drawer was short last night, I think you're not charging people the right amount. We all know you aren't the smartest"". I was confident about being on the cash register until he commented.",117

I remember that before the end of the shift yesterday, my supervisor told me that she would take care of the papers all I need to do is close the store. I put my things down and begin cleaning to start my day, my supervisor comes in and shouts at me saying ""what happened to the papers I told you to put on my desk."" I answered, ""you told me yesterday you would take care of them I just need to close."" She looked at me and said she specifically asked me to put them there several times during the day.

There were a few incidents that I was blamed for, which was very unfair to me. When my supervisor was demonstrating how to make a certain beverage we both reached over for a cup and she accidentaly  knocked over the bag of coffee beans but asked me how I managed to knock them over. This took me by surprise because they were on her side. I proceeded to tell her I didn't do it and she told me to be more careful next time and that I was at fault because im new to the shop.",126
2973,yes,"I always make sure to check the register when closing up for the day. My supervisor pulled me aside once and told me that I hadn't properly locked up for the night, because the register was never opened to be counted for. I wasn't sure what they were talking about, and I told them that I always make sure each night. I was told then that I hadn't checked in, and I definitely missed it because I've been so busy lately. They told me that they wouldn't ever make this up since they're a supervisor and it's their job to check over the employees works. Because of that, I genuinely thought that I forgot to check the register and felt bad.",128

He's the kind of person who gets promoted for being on the job for a long time but not having the work ethic of being a supervisor. At work yesterday my supervisor said to me if I come in late again that I will be fired. In response to him, I said I wasn't late and I've never been late and if I was late how would you even know when you are always late yourself? He then gets upset and says well I'm the one who signs off on your check! I then walk away and proceed to do my work as usual. My other coworker jasmine comes in an hour and a half late and he doesn't say anything to her. I get frustrated how can he accuse me of being late and threaten to fire me for something he knows I didn't do but when someone actually does it he says nothing? I brush it off and continue to work.

Dale receives a message from his supervisor that he is fired due to not showing up for his shift. Dale is confused because he added it to the calander like protocol stated. Fred tells Dale that is not the way it works, why does he think the schedule revolves around him there are other people in the coffee team, he isnt the only one and that Fred is the one to accept or deny all requests off. Fred allows Dale to keep his job but continues to make remarks about how selfish Dale is and is not a team player and makes up his own rules and criticizes anything he does openly to everyone on shift.

The student informs the manager well in advance that she cannot work that shift, and the manager approves their day off. The manager forgets to schedule someone else to cover their shift, and blames it on the student. The manager claims that the student never told him about the exam and because she didn't get the shift covered and notify the manger, that it is the students fault. The student argues back that they did in fact notify the manager well in advance, but the manager proceeds to blame it on the student and blame them for the chaos in the coffee shop during that shift.

Every morning the student comes in at 5:45am when their shift does not start until 6, just to set up and turn all the machines on. For the past few weeks the supervisor has been arriving at 6am, and bringing up that they saw the employee on the camera came in at 5:45. The supervisor tells them they expect them to be there even earlier, so the employee shows up earlier.

I told him that that is what he told me to do. He responded with ""Are you serious? Are you dumb? I would have never said the top cupboard on the left because that is where I keep the mugs!

Today, the supervisor had scolded Amy for giving too much change back to a customer, which resulted in a loss for the shops business and also left uneven change in the register. Amy explained that she only took 2 customer's orders at the register and she swore that both had paid with card. However, her supervisor stated he watched her give the change back to the customer and that only one had paid with card.

The manager kept telling me that I was supposed to clean the bathroom even though i know for sure that it's not what I'm supposed to do.

The supervisor did indeed forget to tell the worker this, but shouts at him that he did tell him and interrupts him every time the worker tries to get a word in.

She makes certain that the grinders are swept, the floors are mopped, and all of the cups are fully stocked. The bar looks immaculate. Suddenly, the manager of the coffee shop runs behind the car in a frenzy, and quickly prepares themself a drink, making a great mess in the process, before retreating to their office to complete next weeks schedule. The student worker is very frustrated, and feels unvalued by her manager. In a moment of frustration, she steps aside from the bar to collect herself. During this moment, the manager returns to the bar for some napkins, and notices that the student worker has stepped aside, and the bar is a complete mess. The manager begins to shout and reprimand the worker for not completing her mid-shift cleaning, and instead taking a leisurely break. The student worker pleads that she did in fact complete her cleaning, and the bar looked fantastic until the manager made such a mess. The manager, now even more upset, insists that they never made such a mess, they would have known if the bar was clean beforehand, and that the student worker is making excuses to get out of her work.

He said I did not make the drink correctly and that I did it too slow as well. I am sure that I did it in a proper amount of time, and I followed the recipe to the 'T', but my supervisor insisted I did it wrong, and procceded to demonstrate to me where I had failed. When I tried to defend myself, he said I had no right to question him as he is my superior.

The student worker proceeds to apologize and explain she's been seeking to go over proper procedure and protocol yet hasn't been allowed to have this conversation nor has anyone offered or acknowledged her. The supervisor insists that she has not once asked for help or to understand better. She knows this is not true since she has asked multiple times as well as sent an email. When she tries to bring this up in a respectful way and ask for help so she can do her job correctly the supervisor says she's lying and continues to get more agitated with her.

The student worker's job that day at work was to make the orders, so of course, they were the one to make this coffee. Since they were extremely busy that day and running behind on orders, the supervisor had to step in and help make the orders with the student worker. The student worker ended up not even making this specific coffee since they were working on another order, so the supervisor made this special coffee with no dairy. Since things were extremely busy that day, the supervisor was very overwhelmed and was not thinking straight. The supervisor accidentally put dairy into the coffee and gave it to the customer. When the customer went to sit down and sipped their coffee, they began to have an immediate negative reaction to the dairy, and they angrily went back up to ask if they had put dairy in their coffee. The supervisor knew that they had messed up, and quickly pretended that the student worker, the only other person making orders, was the one at fault. In order to make their lie more plausible and cover up their mistake, they began to gaslight the student worker into thinking they messed up the order, even though the student worker was not even in charge of that order.",237

The barista gives the bottle back to the manager and that is when the manager realizes that the bottle was empty the whole time.

3184,yes,"Once upon a time, at a bustling coffee shop on a university campus, there was a diligent student worker named Alex. They had been working at the coffee shop for several months, enjoying the vibrant atmosphere and the opportunity to interact with students and faculty.    However, there was one aspect of their job that made it increasingly challenging - their supervisor, Sarah. Sarah was known for her unpredictable behavior and her knack for gaslighting those who worked under her. It seemed as though she derived a strange pleasure from undermining her employees' confidence and distorting reality.    One day, during the busy lunch rush, Alex was handling multiple orders, trying their best to keep up with the ever-growing line of customers. Sarah, observing from a distance, decided to seize the opportunity to exert her gaslighting tactics.    As Alex expertly prepared a cappuccino for a customer, Sarah approached with a sly smile. ""Alex, what are you doing? Can't you see how slow you are? Customers have been complaining about your inefficiency,"" she said, her tone dripping with sarcasm.    Confused and taken aback, Alex looked around, searching for any signs of dissatisfaction from the customers they had been serving. However, everyone seemed content and patiently waiting for their orders. Alex's heart sank, realizing that Sarah was manipulating their perception of reality once again.    ""I... I'm sorry, Sarah. I'm doing my best to keep up with the orders,"" Alex responded, their voice trembling slightly.    Sarah chuckled condescendingly, patting Alex on the back. ""Don't worry, sweetie. We all have off days. Just try to be more aware of your shortcomings next time,"" she said dismissively before walking away, leaving Alex feeling disheartened and doubting their abilities.    Alex knew deep down that they were a competent and hardworking employee. However, Sarah's constant gaslighting began to chip away at their self-esteem, leaving them questioning their own capabilities and feeling trapped in a toxic work environment.    But despite the frequent gaslighting incidents, Alex found solace in their supportive coworkers, who validated their efforts and reminded them of their worth. Slowly, they mustered the strength to stand up to Sarah's manipulation and seek support from higher management to address the toxic behavior within the coffee shop.    Over time, with collective action and a commitment to fostering a healthier work environment, the coffee shop began to transform. Sarah's gaslighting tactics were exposed, and steps were taken to ensure that employees were treated with respect and fairness.    Alex's journey, although challenging, ultimately became a catalyst for positive change, inspiring others to stand up against gaslighting and create a workplace where everyone could thrive and be appreciated for their contributions.

He called me into his office after a meeting he had with some of my co-workers.     ""I'm actually very concerned about your team effort and ability to work here,"" he started, not even waiting for me to sit down. I looked at him puzzled shocked even. I had the official ADA-approved documentation he asked for in my right hand.       I look at him and peer at the paper like a tug of war with my eyes. I start to ask him if he still wants it, floating my arm toward him. He screams, ""you don't get to tell me how you can work! This disrespect will not be tolerated lightly.""    ""And I don't care how much pain you think you're in, you're staying to clean up from last night's shift, end of discussion.""    I distorted all my routes and paths to class to avoid a solemn grave.

The manager responds with yes, everything is fine, why? The student responds with whats shes noticed over the past couple weeks in terms of treatment and also brought up the conversation.

So last Sunday night I was closing and I distinctly remember taking the trash out at the end of the shift, considering it's one of the major parts of closing. But when I came back in the next night, she told me that I hadn't taken it out and that I needed to be more responsible. I obviously had no proof that I had taken it out, but why would I make that up, right?    So flash forward to this week. Wednesday as I was leaving my opening shift, she said she'd see me Friday, since I wasn't scheduled the next day. I was out running errands Thursday afternoon when I get a call from the shop, asking where I am. Confused, I say I'm at the store and ask why. My coworker informs me that my name was on for second shift that day, but I knew for a fact that I hadn't been scheduled that day at all. I begrudgingly go in anyway, since they're now technically understaffed if I was really supposed to be there.    When I get there, my supervisor is in the back and she comes out and basically announces my tardiness to everyone. I'm still really confused and check the schedule.

She looked at me like I'm stupid and said I wasn't added ""last minute"" and that she and I had specifically discussed covering that shift. I definitely didn't remember that discussion and expressed such. She rolled her eyes and told me that I had obviously forgotten and to please pay more attention in the future, but I would have sworn on my life that I had never agreed to take the shift, let alone heard about it.

Even though her and Vanessa were wearing the same uniforms. Vanessa then began to insult Amber's character. Asking her about why she would even consider asking about her wellbeing when she has so much to worry about in the first place. Amber felt as though Vanessa's hostility must be stemming from a situation with her family life, and since she was on the war-path at the moment, decided to just ignore Vanessa's gaslighting attempt and go back to her coffee grinder.

The two weeks pass and the boss sends out the weekend schedule and the employee who told their boss about their vacation was scheduled to work. The worker texts their boss confused because they had previously asked not to be scheduled to which the boss responds with ""I don't remember anything like that, are you sure you actually told me. I would've remembered you were going on vacation when I made the schedule if you had told me.""",111
3380,yes,I don't understand why my manager is out to get me. They keep on giving me the worst shifts for my availability and they say that it's because I keep forgetting to lock the back door and set up the security system during closing even though I double check every time I close. I've asked multiple times if I can see the surveillance footage so that they can prove that I am not closing the shop property but they refuse to show me the video and say that they are offended that I would doubt their word. I feel like I'm going crazy and no one is willing to back me up. Maybe I should just quit. ,121
3419,yes,"When I first started working, my manager would compliment me on how fast I was learning and how good of a job I was doing. Obviously I was thrilled that I have thriving in my new work environment. It wasn't until later that they  would start to criticize me for the way I would make a drink, treat a guest, or clean up. It got to a point where they would call me names such as incompetent and useless. As far as I could remember, all they work I had being doing was the same as when I did it in the beginning. The only thing that had changed was his attitude. I started to doubt myself so I changed the way I did things, tried new ways to make specific drinks, tried to be nicer to the guests and did more excessive clean ups. It wasn't until a corporate visit that I realized I was doing everything against protocol and almost got fired.",166

I see my first table of the day I am so excited to start the day of right, I go to the table and act in my cheery manner, I notice that my boss is looking at me funny. When I  go behind the counter to put in the order the boss tells me I am mixing business with pleasure, that is far from the truth that never even happened. All I have ever done was try and create a safe friendly environment.",113
3448,yes,"One day the student worker is done their shift and therefore clocks out for the day, the supervisor realizes that the student worker still has tasks but lets the student worker clock out. after the supervisor lets them clock out the supervisor walks up to the student and tells them they still have tasks and that they need to complete them. Instead of the supervisor allowing them to clock back in they say that it was the students fault for not checking in with them first and that now they have to finish the tasks while off the clock meaning it is unpaid. The reason for why the supervisor didn't want them to clock back in was because the student would have then reached overtime and they actually don't have the money to give overtime to workers.",139
3465,yes,"In a campus coffee shop, a student worker encountered subtle gaslighting from their supervisor. The supervisor, without naming specifics, questioned the worker's competence, alluding to a perceived lack of ability based on race rather than political views. One incident unfolded during a routine shift when the supervisor approached the worker with a dubious expression. ""Are you sure you're handling the orders correctly?"" they asked, a tone of skepticism evident in their voice. The worker was caught off guard, nevertheless responded confidently, detailing their adherence to established procedures. However, the supervisor persisted, implying a connection between the worker's race and their shortcomings. ""Maybe it's just a cultural thing,"" they remarked, a thinly veiled insinuation that left the worker feeling disheartened. On another occasion, the supervisor took issue with the worker's communication style. ""Customers seem uneasy when you talk to them,"" they remarked, implying that the worker's natural mannerisms, rooted in their cultural background, were somehow problematic. The worker, keenly aware of the gaslighting, maintained composure, expressing a commitment to excellent customer service.",177
3472,yes,"The student worker goes to their supervisor showing proof that their pay has been reduced, and the supervisor denies it completely and begins berating the student worker for creating lies and for being selfish. To the student worker, they are now doubting the proof they have due to the negative feelings induced by the berating. The student worker begins to feel like they're making things up and are going crazy, and their supervisor feeds into these types of thoughts and feelings knowingly. At the end of the situation, the supervisor leaves after successfully avoiding the matter at hand and gaining all the power they could while the student worker leaves feeling doubtful, guilty, and less secure.",117
3476,yes,"The manager often approves things that the workers asks i.e. when breaks can occur, when they can take extended leave, if it was okay to not do something or close up in a certain way, but when asked later, does not say they allowed for this to happen. If corporate or the manager themselves find fault with the worker, they deny ever allowing anything to happen. The manager appears to forget or just outright denying allowing or giving their permission for anything, absolving them of any blame. This leaves the worker having done things that were initially green-lit but getting gaslit into thinking they weren't allowed to or that the manager would never do such a thing. ",120
3481,yes,"The student worker is dealing with a difficult customer and the customer orders a drink that is very specific and hard to make. The student worker tries their best to make it and when they hand it to the customer, they say that the drink is completely wrong and want to speak to their supervisor. The student worker made it right but the customer switched what they wanted at the end. The supervisor was listening to the entire transaction and proceeds to belittle the student worker by saying things like ""they obviously said ___ instead of whatever that is"" and ""the customer was very clear about what they wanted"". They then give the customer the ""right"" drink.",117
3496,yes,"When the student worker arrived for a shift the next morning, the supervisor looked angry and the coffee shop was a mess. The supervisor yelled at the worker for not closing properly the night before. Confused, the worker explained that the supervisor had told them to go home early the night before, and that the supervisor had said he would close. The supervisor got more aggravated and said he would never do that, and that it is not his job. He says it wouldn't even make sense for him to close because that's the student worker's job, so therefore it is the worker's fault. ",108
3497,yes,"One day the student worker came into work dressed a little different that day. The boss kept on giving the student dirty looks and whispering in other coworkers ears ovboiiusly about the student. When the student asked his or her boss he said i don't know what your talking about and walked away. Later that day, the student really wanted to ask him again so she/he did and he started yelling at her calling her delusional saying nothing ever happened. The more she started to think about it, the less she/he thought he was saying things. The boss easily manipulated her/her thinking he never said anything but in reality he did. ",115

I went about my day, and everything seemed fine. As I was getting ready to start doing my homework, however, my phone rang suddenly, causing me to jump. I picked up, and I heard my supervisor berate me, asking me why I did not show up for my scheduled shift. I tried to tell her that I already sent in my notice that I wouldn't be in today, and all she told me was that my co-worker, who was supposed to go in today, called out sick today. I again tried to tell her that I already called in, but she just kept on yelling. ",139

The worker calmly tries to explain that they did charge the correct amount and offers to show the supervisor the electronic receipt of the transaction. After the supervisor is shown the receipt, the supervisor continues to insist that the amount was wrong and scold the worker, regardless of the actual events that took place. The worker grows frustrated and begins to raise their voice, just trying to be heard, but the supervisor will not let up. Eventually, the worker gives up and just accepts the gaslighting coming from their supervisor and lets the supervisor believe what they want to regarding the worker-customer interaction.",128

Alex had meticulously followed the given instructions for brewing a new coffee blend.

Confused and questioning their own competence, Alex sought clarification, only to be met with an exasperated sigh and an insistence that they should have known better.

The student doesn't realize this and works their full day anyways. The next pay week rolls around and the student realizes they missed a day of pay. They bring it up to their manager to which the manager tells the student they didnt come into work that day.

3580,yes,"Today was a good day, I thought. I had respectful customers, got good tips and was able to have conversations and lunch with my friends since it wasn't too busy today. As I was getting ready to close up and was cleaning the counters, someone bumped into me and I heard a clatter and a curse. I turn around quickly to apologize when I see my supervisor's fuming face as her drink fell on the floor. Before I could say anything, she started to scream at me, asking what my problem was and why I was being unessacarily rude to her: I didn't open the door for her when she came in, I didn't smile when I said hi to her and I purposefully bumped into.  As she raged, I was stunned because I didn't even recall seeing her today until now and she was the one who bumped into me. As I apologized she began telling me that I should have apologized immediately and should have taken accountability for my actions. Seeing her so upset and angry I began to doubt myself; perhaps I was being rude to her unknowingly or taking my life's frustrations out on her. So I began to apologize more profusely and urgently telling her I'm so sorry, I was being selfish and took my frustrations out on you. ",231

Are you sure that you don't have to ask her again the specifics to her drink?""

Today, when I came into work I realized that we ran out of those flavors and there were no extras, so I let my manger know. His response was that I should have told him sooner that we were running low because it takes up to two weeks for the syrups to come in. I told him I didn't know that information because I am not the one that orders supplies and he said I should have told him when the bottles were around half empty because it is common sense and now it is my fault that we ran out and I would have to let the customer know that we don't have some of the flavors they want. I just think he should have told me when I started that I would have to let him know that we need to order more when the bottles get half empty.",180
3605,yes,"For this example, we can say the student worker has consistently worked the closing shift and was responsible for cleaning and locking up the coffee shop. However, every morning, the supervisor calls the student worker to complain about leaving a messy work environment and not properly locking the doors. Because of these perceived inadequacies, the supervisor also insults and uses degrading language towards the worker. These actions make the worker feel conflicted about their actions and question whether they have been working hard enough or if they cannot fulfill the tasks being asked of them. But, in reality, the worker left no mess, and the supervisor was acting out of disdain for the worker and wanted to shame them. ",119

The next day when the student worker has work, the supervisor calls them into their office, where then the supervisor begins to yell at the student worker. Apparently the supervisor, said that the student worker didn't inform them they were taking more than one day off, and due to that they had to understaffed and other people had to work extra because of the student worker not being there. When in actuality the boss wanted the student worker to take extra days off, as to not get other sick. The student feels bad for the incident, even when they believe that the boss has allowed them for days off, but thought they heard wrong due to them being sick. The student worker apologizes and ask to work extra days in order to make up for the days they missed. The supervisor agrees, and the student worker is still upset because the supervisor made them believe that they took days off without asking, causing an inconvenience to others.
